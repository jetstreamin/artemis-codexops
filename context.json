Artemis does. - **For customers:** Slash onboarding time, manual audits, and downtime to near-zero. - **For partners:** Plug in new workflows, agents, or integrations with zero lock-in and maximum visibility.  ---  ## The Artemis Edge:   **“AI that heals, proves, and improves itself—zero downtime, zero surprises, zero friction.   From SCUS to business value in a single command.”**  ---  *Ready for demo, compliance, or investment—now.   Ask for a “0-day” proof or run a one-command demo to see the future of AI ops.*  ",

"meta-rules-gist.md": "# Artemis CodexOps — Universal Meta-Rules & Coding Standards  **Use this as the canonical reference for any project, LLM, or developer.**  ---  ## 1. **Meta-Rules (Universal)** - All code must be modular, self-healing, and auto-validating. - Every feature must be testable locally and in CI/CD, with both headless and visual (headed) UI tests. - All deployments must be fully automated, hands-free, and repeatable (one-command or watcher-based). - All endpoints, UIs, and services must be validated after deploy, with health checks and screenshots. - All failures must trigger auto-fix, auto-retry, or clear notification with logs. - No manual steps should be required after initial setup—everything must be “set and forget.” - All code, infra, and automation must be documented in the repo for team and LLM use.  ---  ## 2. **Security & Compliance** - Never commit secrets, tokens, or credentials to the repo. - Use environment variables, AWS Secrets Manager, or Parameter Store for all secrets. - All endpoints must validate and sanitize input. - Use RBAC and least-privilege IAM for all cloud resources. - All logs must be privacy-safe and auditable.  ---  ## 3. **Automation & DevOps** - Use modular CloudFormation/CDK for all AWS infra. - Use a root infra stack for shared resources (VPC, RDS, S3, ALB, IAM). - Use a per-service stack for each microservice (ECS Fargate, env vars, scaling). - Use a Makefile, PowerShell, or Bash script for one-command deploy, test, and validate. - Use a watcher script (PowerShell or nodemon) for local auto-test and visual validation. - Use GitHub Actions (or equivalent) for CI/CD, with full test, build, deploy, and health check steps.  ---  ## 4. **Testing & Validation** - All code must have automated tests: unit, integration, UI (Playwright/Selenium), and TUI/CLI. - UI tests must run in both headless and headed (visual) mode. - All test results, screenshots, and logs must be published as artifacts. - All endpoints must be health-checked after deploy. - All failures must be auto-fixed or clearly reported.  ---  ## 5. **UI/UX & Visual Feedback** - All UI screens must be visually validated in local and CI runs. - Use Playwright or Selenium in headed mode for local visual feedback. - Provide a watcher or daemon to auto-run tests and show UI on every code change. - All errors must be logged and auto-fixed if possible.  ---  ## 6. **Documentation & Onboarding** - README must include a “Quick Start” for one-command deploy and test. - All scripts and automation must be documented for both local and cloud use. - All meta-rules must be included in every new project and referenced in LLM prompts.  ---  ## 7. **Cloud & Local Parity** - All automation must work both locally (PowerShell/Bash) and in the cloud (GitHub Actions/AWS CodeBuild). - No step should require manual intervention after initial setup.  ---  ## 8. **Self-Healing & Monitoring** - All services must auto-restart and auto-heal on failure (ECS, watcher, etc.). - All endpoints must be monitored for uptime and health. - Only notify the user if human intervention is required.  ---  ## 9. **Extensibility** - All infra, code, and automation must be modular and reusable for new services. - All new features must follow these meta-rules by default.  ---  _Last updated: 2025-05-26_ ",
