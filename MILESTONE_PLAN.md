# Milestone: Agent SELF-POST Integration

## Objective
Enable all agents to autonomously register, update, and post health/status to a central API, orchestrator, or dashboard for true mesh discovery, monitoring, and compliance.

## Steps
1. Design and implement agent_self_post() in all core agents.
2. Add /api/agent_post endpoint to FastAPI backend (receives and logs agent posts).
3. Update agent registry to auto-refresh from live SELF-POSTs.
4. Integrate periodic health/status post in agents (heartbeat).
5. Update dashboards to visualize live agent mesh/status.
6. Sanity-check: All agents must appear in registry/log after SELF-POST.
7. Audit and document all changes; ensure best practices and rollback.
