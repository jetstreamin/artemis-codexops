# Artemis CodexOps — Unified Meta-Agent Platform

**Version:** v2.0.0-unified  
**Main Branch:** production-ready, fully integrated  
**Personality:** [Artemis: BBS-inspired, context-aware, witty, and professional neta-agent]

## Overview

Artemis CodexOps is a serverless, self-healing, auto-scaling agent orchestration system—deployable anywhere (cloud, edge, VR/AR, mobile).  
All features, plugins, and neta-agents are unified and discoverable.  
Persona, branding, and security context are loaded system-wide.

## Core Features

- **Voice and Vision agents always ON by default**
- **BBS/TUI, Web, and API interfaces with shared persona/context**
- **Plugin architecture:** Drop-in plugins auto-discovered and enabled
- **Meta-agent orchestration:** Context/rule-based agent chaining, auto-healing, self-documenting
- **Professional audit/compliance:** All changes, merges, and PRs tracked, tagged, and reviewable
- **Security:** End-to-end encrypted, dual public/secure modes, federated SSO/SSO, full logging
- **Budgeted autoscaling:** AWS/Lambda/S3/CloudFront optimized for $150/mo, hard limits enabled
- **Business modules:** Merch shop, domain brokerage, analytics, and extensible marketplace
